IOS Version of Assignment 1 for CS441 - Binghamton University

Ugurcan Demir

# Homework : 
  It doesn't have to be fancy. It doesn't have to look amazing. There are thousands of "hello world" app tutorials on the web that have blinking lights, audio recordings of "hello" in a hundred languages, and that show you on the globe where people say different things.  Don't use the app tutorials (except to see how things work).

  Build it from scratch.  Connect some buttons so that your app does something.

# The application idea : 
  This simple application generates the Hello World Display with a button that allows a user to change the Hello World label.
